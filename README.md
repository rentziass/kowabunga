# kowabunga
Script to kickstart a new Ubuntu machine for development as **I** like it to be.

## Quickstart
- Download the script
- `chmod +x kowabunga.sh`
- `./kowabunga.sh`

This script refers to my dotfiles. I will implement a configurable version soon, meanwhile you may fork this repo and tweak as you prefer!
